# Network-Security-nmap



Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is an open-source network scanning tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
   
It is designed to allow users to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a map of the network.
   
Nmap sends packets to the target network and analyzes the responses to discover what hosts are available, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of firewall is in use, and other information about the network. It can scan for open ports on target hosts, which can help in identifying services running on those hosts and potential vulnerabilities associated with those services.

Nmap can determine the versions of services running on target hosts. This information is crucial for understanding potential security risks associated with outdated software versions.
It can analyze the responses from target hosts to determine the operating systems they are running. This information is useful for network administrators and security professionals to understand the diversity of systems on their network and to tailor security measures accordingly.

It can be used to test the effectiveness of firewalls and intrusion detection systems by attempting to bypass them and determine what hosts and services are still reachable from outside the network.
It assists in auditing the security posture of a network by identifying potential points of entry for attackers, such as open ports or outdated software.

**How to Use Nmap**

1. **Installation**: Nmap is available for various platforms including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It can be downloaded and installed from the official Nmap website or through package managers like apt or yum.

2. **Basic Scanning**: To perform a basic scan of a target host or network, simply open a terminal and type `nmap <target>`, where `<target>` can be an IP address, hostname, or network range.




Once the scan is complete, carefully analyze the results to identify open ports, services, and potential security vulnerabilities. Pay attention to the state of ports (open, closed, filtered), service versions, and operating system guesses provided by Nmap.
