# Network-Security-nmap



Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is an open-source network scanning tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
   
It is designed to allow users to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a map of the network.
   
Nmap sends packets to the target network and analyzes the responses to discover what hosts are available, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of firewall is in use, and other information about the network. It can scan for open ports on target hosts, which can help in identifying services running on those hosts and potential vulnerabilities associated with those services.



**How to Use Nmap**

1. **Installation**: Nmap is available for various platforms including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It can be downloaded and installed from the official Nmap website or through package managers like apt or yum.

2. **Basic Scanning**: To perform a basic scan of a target host or network, simply open a terminal and type `nmap <target>`, where `<target>` can be an IP address, hostname, or network range.

**How to run the python file**

from the command line enter below command:

`python <python-filename>`
